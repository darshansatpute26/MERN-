<p>Misal Pav is a popular and flavorful dish from Maharashtra, India, often enjoyed as a breakfast or snack. The dish consists of two main components: misal, a spicy curry, and pav, soft Indian bread rolls. The misal is made using sprouted moth beans (matki) cooked with a blend of spices like turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, and asafoetida. Its flavor profile is bold, combining spiciness, tanginess, and a hint of sweetness, often enhanced with tamarind or jaggery. Depending on the region, the curry can vary in consistency, either being soupy or drier. The pav is served alongside the misal, often toasted with butter, and is used to scoop up the curry. The dish is topped with garnishes such as crispy sev (fried chickpea noodles), fresh chopped onions, coriander, and sometimes a wedge of lemon to add a refreshing tang. Misal Pav is known for its bold spice level, which can be adjusted according to taste, and it is often accompanied by yogurt or buttermilk to balance the heat. Commonly found at roadside stalls or local eateries in Maharashtra, Misal Pav holds cultural significance as a quick, satisfying meal. Itâ€™s a beloved street food, celebrated for its vibrant combination of textures and flavors.</p>
